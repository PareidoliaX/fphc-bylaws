# History of Fairlea Park Housing Co-operative

In the early 1980s, the city began to have study sessions called "Action Walkley". They wanted to find out from the people in the area what could be done with the land South of Fairlea Crescent, which was owned by the National Capital Commission (NCC) at the time.
Clake Christy was in attendance at these meetings. Within the year he began advertising in the Heatherington-Heron Gate areas to see if there was any interest in co-operative (co-op) housing. Meetings were held at the Heatherington portables. As a result, Mike and Carol Murray became involved and the three of them began procedures to form the Fairlea Park Housing Co-operative.
Through his own personal interest, Peter Trotscha lent his expertise to this fledgling group. At that time Peter was working for City Living, yet very involved in the private co-op housing sector. In 1983 he was hired by the Ottawa Federation of Housing Co-ops and became our official consultant. Also at the time, Robin Mckay was selected as the lawyer to advise Fairlea Park Housing Co-operative (the Co-op) on legal matters.
In early 1983, application was made to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) for a Phase 1 start-up. By early fall we still had no reply from CMHC. Community Works, whose main purpose is to support co-operative ventures in Ottawa, lent us $1000 at our request while we wre still waiting. Finally, in December of 1983 our Phase 1 start-up application was approved and funds became available to the tune of $10 000. Now we were able to pay the bills! bills! bills!.
Our incorporators were:

* Clarke Christy
* Mike and Carol Murray
* Catherine Mitchell
* David Wales

A second parcel of land that boarders the Fairlea Park and our Co-op was purchased in December, 1987 with the intentions of creating 33 new town homes. After an enormous amount of work done by our legal counsel and the Ottawa Federation of Housing Co-operatives in obtaining rezoning application approvals, we were ready to commence construction.
The Phase 2 of our Co-op construction began in March, 1988 and was completed in its entirety by mid-August, 1988. These new homes were developed under the Federal Index-Linked Mortgage (ILM) Co-operative Housing Programme with the Rent Supplement portion being administered provincially.
Phase 1 of our Co-op built under the previous 56.1 Federal Co-operative Housing programme. It's Rent-geared-to-income (RGI) component is administered federally.
