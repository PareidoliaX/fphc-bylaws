# Co-operative Principles

## Open membership

Co-operatives are open without exception to anyone who needs their services and freely accepts the obligations of membership.

## Democratic control

Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies, making decisions and electing leaders who report to them. In primary co-operatives each member has one vote. Housing co-operatives give members the information they need to make good decisions and take part in the life of the co-operative through members meetings, committees, and the Board of Directors. Some examples democratic member control are: the approval of a budget, electing the Board of Directors and approving by-laws. 

## Economic participation

Members contribute financially to the co-operative and share in the benefits of membership. In the case of not-for-profit housing co-operatives, the co-operative does not pay a return on the members' shares of deposits, instead it sets aside reserves for the future and charges the members only what it needs to operate soundly now and into the future.

## Autonomy and Independence

Housing co-operatives are independent associations. They follow the laws that apply to them and their agreements with governments or other organizations. But the members control the co-operative.

## Co-operation among co-operatives

Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.

## Concern for Community

Housing co-operatives work to build strong communities inside and outside the co-operative. They help to improve the quality of life for others and they take care to protect the environment. Co-operatives meet members' needs in ways that build lasting communities within and beyond each co-operative.
