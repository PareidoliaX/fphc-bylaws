This By-law sets down provisions that relate to the allocation of assistance by the Co-op and the rights and responsibilities of members receiving assistance.

## Eligibility Requirements
1. Only applicants for whom the market housing charge equals more than 25% of their adjusted gross monthly household income are eligible for geared-to-income assistance, as per the 56.1 Agreement.

3. Applicants must be Canadian Citizens or landed immigrants, and must be resident members of the Co-operative.

If a member receiving housing charge assistance ceases to have the family size appropriate for the unit occupied as set out in section 2.1, the member will be offered the first two units of appropriate size that become available. If the member refuses both units offered, the housing charge assisance shall terminate three months after such refusal.

## Definition of Income
For the purpose of setting geared-income housing charges, the definitions of income contained in Appendix A attached shall be used. Only the following types of income shall be excluded for the purpose of calculating housing charges:

## Annual Verification of Income and Household Composition
Members receiving housing charge assistance shall provide the Co-op with a signed declaration of gross income, assets and household size and composition annually. Each member shall promptly report to the Co-op, in writing, any change in any of the information given.

## Changes in Income

### Increases in Income
All increases in gross household income must be reported to the Co-op promptly. The assistance allocation will be adjusted if the increase in income is more than $100 per month or, in the case of members receiving social assistance, if there is an increase in the shelter component. (Note: The dollar amount relating to increases in household income should be reviewed annually by the Board of adjusted as necessary.)

### Notice of Increase
The Co-op shall give the member 60 days notice of any such adjustment except in the case of members receiving social assistance where the adjustment shall be made at the time the shelter component is increased. 

### Decreases in Income
Housing charges shall be adjusted during the year if a member reports a decrease in household income, provided that funds are available. If the income returns to a higher level within the same year, the member shall report such an increase promptly and the housing charge shall be adjusted at the beginning of the month following to reflect the increase.

## Utility Costs
The monthly housing charge to members receiving assistance will be adjusted by the amount allowed by Canada Morgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) for non fully serviced accomodation where member residents pay their own heating costs.

On an annual basis, the Board will review the fully serviced scale allowance for heating costs relative to the actual costs incurred by members.

## Waiting Lists

### Internal Waiting List
1. A waiting list will be established consiting of Co-op members who meet the Eligibility Requirements set out in section 1 and the Occupancy Guidlines set out in section 2.
2. Priority for allocation of assistance (both permanent and emergency) will be based on date of completed application.

### External Waiting List
Separate waiting lists will be maintained for applicants not requiring housing charge assistance, applicants requiring assistance, and applicants for units for the disabled. The following guidlines will be followed when assistance is available which is not required internally:

1. Prior to initial full occupancy, the Board will allocate assistance taking into consideration the applicant's position on the waiting list and board targets for initial distribution of assistance.
2. After initial full occupancy, when assistance is available which is not required internally or reserved for emergencies, assistance will be offered to the first person on the waiting list who requires assistence that is not greater than the total assistance dollars available at the time. 

## Emergency Assistance
1. Every month, a portion of the 56.1 assistance pool, in an amount to be determined by the directors from time to time, will be reserved for short-term, emergency allocation. Eligibility for emergency assistance will be restricted to those who, without assisance, would be paying more than 40% of their adjusted gross monthly household income on housing charges (excluding utilities).
2. Emergency assistance will only be allocated to housholds already resident in the Co-op except as provided in section 9.
3. If a household on the waiting list for permanent assistance is allocated emergency assistance, that household shall retain its place on the waiting list and will be allocated on a permanent basis except as provided in section 9.
4. Eligible households may receive emergency assistance for a period to be determined by the Board. Emergency assistance will not normally be granted for a period exceeding six months.
5. Households receiving emergency assistance are required to report promptly to the Co-op any increase in income. If a household ceases to be eligible for emergency assistance because of an increase in income, assistance will be withdrawn at the beginning of the month following the increase.
6. Members receiving emergency assistance must meet the eligility requirements set out in section 1.1.

## Allocation of Emergency Assistance to Disabled Applicants
In cases where a vacating member occupying a unit for the disabled was not receiving assistance, but the new membr will require assistance and no permanent assistance is available, emergency assistance may be allocated on a permanent basis. In such cases, the eligibility criteria will be those outlined in section 1.
## False Declaration of Income
Where a household is discovered to have falsely declared its income, or failed to report an increase in income, it will be required retroactively to reimburse the Co-op for assistance funds allocated to its account unjustifiably. Where the household refuses to reimburse the Co-op, the amount of the reimbursement claimed by the Co-op will be deemed to be arrears of housing charges under the Occupancy By-law, and eviction proceedings will be initiated, pursuant to the Occupancy Agreement and By-law.

## Households Being Evicted
Where a household is being evicted, any assistence allocated will be terminated effective on the date at which the household is required to vacate the unit.

## Subletting
1. Members will not be permitted to assign or sublet their unit and continue to receive housing charge assistance while the unit is assigned or sublet.
2. Members receiving housing charge assistance who assign or sublet their unit are eligible to apply to have assistance reserved for a period of up to six months for their use upon moving back into the Co-op. To be eligible, members must be members in good standing for at least two years prior to subletting and must make application before subletting their unit. Prior to moving back into the Co-op, such members must complete the Co-op's Housing Charge Assistance application form and provide updated proof of income.
During the period of the sublet, the assistance may be assigned to another resident on an emergency basis but will be reassigned to the member who have suble when they return.
3. Members receiving assistance who plan to sublet their unit for a period longer than six months are eligible to have their names placed on the internal waiting list for assistance. For the purpose of determining the position on the waiting list, the date of application shall be considered to be the date of application for the subsidy they most recently received. To be eligible, members must be member in good standing for at least two years prior to subletting and must make application before they sublet their unit. Prior to moving back into the Co-op, such members must complete the Co-op's Housing Charge Assistance application form and provide updated proof of income.

## Application and Approval Procedures
1. Households applying for assistance must complete the Co-op's Housing Charge Assistance application form and provide the required proof of income annually in order to be eligible for assistance.
