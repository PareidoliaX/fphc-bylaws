# Fairlea Park Phase 2 By-Law 13

A by-law to amend by-law #6 in respect of housing charge assistance for members residing in Phase 2 of Fairlea Park Housing Co-operative.

## Preamble

Housing charge assistance for members residing in Phase 2 of Fairlea Park Housing Co-operative is delivered and administered under the terms of the Rent Supplement Program established by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the the Ontario Ministry of Housing. The terms and conditions of this Rent Supplement Program differ substantially from the guidelines established in by-law #6 (Housing charge Assistance By-Law) for Phase 1 of the Co-operative.

It is therefore necessary to amend by-law #6 to reflect these differences.

## Article

For the purpose of allocating geared-to-income asistance (rent supplement assistance) to members residing in Phase 2 of Fairlea Park Housing Co-operative, the Guidelines and Procedures established by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation for the Rent Supplement Program shall prevail over the terms and conditions of By-law #6, particularly with respect to:

* eligibility requirements
* occupancy guidelines
* definition of income
* verification of income
* changes in income
* calculation of adjusted housing charges
* waiting lists
* emergency assistance

The terms of by-law #6 shall be inoperative with respect to Phase 2 of Fairlea Park Housing Co-operative to the extent that they contradict the Guidelines and procedures noted in paragraph 1.01.

Fairlea Park Housing Co-perative may, through the introduction of subsequent by-laws, alter the manner in which rent supllement is administered for Phase 2 residents, provided that the terms of such by-laws do not contravene regulartions established by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation or the Ontario Ministry of Housing.
